		  <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>

		  <br>

		 <p class="p1"> When it comes to exercise, we think about how to “get” fit. But often, starting out is not the problem. “The big problem is maintaining it,” says Falko Sniehotta, a professor of behavioural medicine and health psychology at Newcastle University.</p>

     <br>

  	 <h3>Bodybuilding is the process of developing muscle fibres through the combination of weight training, increased caloric intake, and rest.</h3>

     <br>
        <p class="p2">  Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes.
		  An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.
		  In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.
		  Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.

   		  In the modern bodybuilding industry, the term "professional" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a "pro card" from their respective organization.
		  Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card. Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.
